:ac1: ...Good to be back. Took long enough.
:ac1: I was getting reeeaally sick of that stupid smug persona...
:ac1: Are you satisfied? Is this the challenge you were hoping for?
:bf3: ...Boop?
:ac2: Idiot. You can't concieve what you're up against. Void is gone.
:ac2: You're looking at the physical avatar of the abyss.
:ac1: This isn't about wealth, or admiration... My influence has reached a critical mass.
:ac1: It won't be long before I've got every soul in the universe at my fingertips...
:ac1: That includes you. AND your girlfriend. If you knew your place, you'd sit back and be a spectator.
:ac2: A NOBODY.
:ac1: I was hoping you'd learn this. But if you really won't go without a fight, fine by me.
:ac2: Been a while since I've torn something apart.
:bf4: Ha, Doo BEEP!
:ac1: Your confidence is exhausting. You really think you're somebody, then?
:ac1: You won't be standing after this without clawing your way out with everything you've got.
:ac2: Come on, then. Come face a true cosmic threat.
:ac3: COME FACE THE ALL-CONSUMING VOID!!!
