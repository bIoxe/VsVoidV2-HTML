You guys are bigger fans than I thought, huh?

Funny that you actually thought I wouldn't eventually come across this stuff. I appreciate the attention to detail.
Now look. I'm super busy, I bet you don't realize how much stuff I'm putting off just to write this. So I'm only
gonna say this once, got it?

If you ever think, EVER, that you can touch me and all that I've built, you've got another thing coming. With this
much info you should know exactly what I'm capable of. And if you STILL think what you're doing is a good idea,
I will personally make sure NONE OF YOU EVER SEE SUNLIGHT AGAIN, I WILL MAKE SURE EVERY ONE OF Y







note to self:
-get the guys to finish this
-get the guys to schedule fitting
-get the guys to call back brand deal guy
-pay the guys maybe idk whatever
